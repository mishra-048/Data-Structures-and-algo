There are two types of the graph
(i)Undirected
            v1--------v3
            |          | \
            |          |  \
            |          |   v5
            |          |  /
            |          | /
            v2--------v4


(ii)Directed



//Just for testing 
// Walk->Travelling through the nodes in which repeatation is allowed
         For a walk there should be an edge available for it;
         v1,v2,v4 is a walk but v1,v5 is not a walk as there is not an edge in the walk.

//
// Path->Path is a special walk in which no repeatation is allowed.

----  In some books a walk is termed as a path and a path is termed a simple path.  ----

// A graph is called cyclic when a walk starts and ends on the same vertix.
// Weighted graph is a graph in which every edge is assigned some weight which is generally given according to the lenght of the edge.

// Bipartite Graph: It is an undirected graph G = (V, E) in which V = V1 + V2 and there are edges only between vertices in V1 and V2



//Representation of the graphs
(i)Adjacency Matrix->for undirected graph it forms a symmetric matrix
Prefered when :
                The graph is dense : |E| is close to |v|2
                We need to quickly determine if there is an edge between two vertices
Disadvantages:
                No quick way to determine the vertices adjacent to another
    // Operations on the graph
    Space Required: Q(v*v)
    Operations :
        Check if u and v are adjacent: Q(1);
        Find all vertices adjacent to u: Q(v);
        Find degree of u: Q(v);
        Add /Remove an edge : Q(1);
        Add/Remove a vertex : Q(v2);
    Problems :
    It is storing the retendent information i.e It is storing the information of the edges which is
    present but also it is storing the information of the edges which is not present also.

(ii)Adjacency List->In this we have an array of lists where lists are most popularly represented as :
                    (a)Dynamics Sized Arrays
                    (b)Linked lists


              Undirected graph V+2E
            /
Space O(V+E)
            \
              Directed graph V+E

    Operations :
    Check if there is an edge from u to v:O(v)
    Find all adjacent of u : O(degree (u))
    Find degree of u : O(1)
    Add an edge : O(1)
    Remove an edge : O(v)

                1) |0|---|2|

                2) |0|---|1|---|3|
                    _
                3) |2|

    // Prefered when : The graph is sparce :|E|<<|V|2
                        We need to quickly determine the nodes adjacent to the given nodes
    // Disadvantages:
                        No quick way to determine whether there is an edge between node u and v
